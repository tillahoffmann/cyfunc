⚠️ cyfunc is deprecated ⚠️
===========================

Cyfunc provided an interface to expose Cython functions as `universal functions <https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/ufuncs.html>`__ for numpy. As of `cython/cython#4803 <https://github.com/cython/cython/pull/4803>`_, ufuncs are natively supported by Cython, obviating the need for this package. See `the official documentation <https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/src/userguide/numpy_ufuncs.html>`_ for more information.
